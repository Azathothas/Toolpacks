!#CFLAGS :: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html
#        :: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GCC_optimization
#        :: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
# -O2 --> Optimizes by 2x [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#index-O2]
# -fpie/-fPIE --> Allows position independent executable (Used by -static-pie in LDFALGS)
#  -fpie | -fPIPE both define the macros "__pie__" and "__PIE__". The macros have the value 1 for -fpie and 2 for -fPIE.
# -w --> Inhibits all warning messages [-Wall --> All Warnings | -Werror --> Treats warnings as failures]
# -pipe --> Use pipes rather than temporary files (Consumes Memory/RAM, but faster)

!#LDFLAGS :: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html
# -static --> This overrides -pie and prevents linking with the shared libraries 
#  Note: This sets -static as defaults, so for an example: static-libgcc is used instead of -shared-libgcc
# -static-pie --> Produce a static position independent executable on targets that support it
#  Note : -pie --> Produces Dynamically linked position independent executable, hence use -static-pie
#       : Also requires that we pass -fpie | -fPIE as CFLAGS
# ⚠️ -no-pie --> Don’t produce a dynamically linked position independent executable. [This disables pie for everything, only use if default doesn't work]
# -s --> Strips all symbol table and relocation information from the executable. 
# 
# -fuse-ld=mold --> Use mold as ld [https://github.com/rui314/mold/blob/main/docs/mold.md] 🦠
# Remove the opts if mold isn't installed or you don't want to use mold 
# -Wl --> Passes option to the linker, mold in this case
#  Note: Must use -Wl,$MOLD_OPTIONS for mold
# ⚠️⚠️ WARNING: pass these only if default LDFLAGS didn't work and mold has to be used specifically
#    Often these executables result in Segmentation Faults/Core Dumps
# ⚠️  -Wl,--pie --> Create a position-independent executable. (This is either Dynamic/Static based on other $OPTS)
#     -Wl,--Bstatic --> Do not link against shared libraries. (Similar to -no-pie)
#     -Wl,--static --> Do not link against shared libraries. (Similar to -static)
#     -Wl,-S --> Strips all symbol table and relocation information from the executable. (Similar to -s)
#     -Wl,--build-id --> Embeds (md5 | sha1 | sha256 | uuid | 0x${hexstring} | none), default is sha1. 
#     -Wl,--no-build-id --> same as -Wl,--build-id=none

# -f | --file=file | --makefile=FILE --> Path to makefile
# -j | --jobs="$(($(nproc)+1))" --> Fancy shell maths to auto specify maximum threads for make jobs
# -k | --keep-going --> Continue as much as possible after an error
# -n | --just-print | --dry-run | --recon --> Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.
# -s | --silent | --quiet --> Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

# Run: make dest clean 2>/dev/null ; make clean 2>/dev/null --> To cleanup
